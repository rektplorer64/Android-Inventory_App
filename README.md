# Generic Inventory App

<p>A simple Android application that help you remember your belongings!</p>
</div>

## ðŸš© Motivations
After finishing the first year of study at Mahidol University, the Faculty of ICT, I was equipped with knowledge and 
skills in Java programming language and desire to put Android knowledge from self-study (via Udacity) to a better use. 
I decided to create an application that allows me to understand the underlying Android application framework even more.

The application that I choose to build is a simple personal inventory manager.  

## ðŸ˜€ Features
- [x] Persistent local inventory database via an early version of Room Database
- [x] Image Storage for each item
- [x] Item tagging by a color or terms 
- [x] Responsive layout
    - Dual-pane for tablet
    - Single-pane for vertical form-factor devices and phones
- [x] Customizable item list view (Grid/List)
- [x] Detailed item search and filters
- [x] User Reviewing (Mimicked)
- [ ] ~~Online Data Synchronization~~ Out of the project scope during that time

## ðŸ–¼ Screenshots
There are two panes that uses the screen real-estate efficiently.
